            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>On the 2. of this in≈øtant moneth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords day, our Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in chiefe of the Sea Forces, received a packet from a ≈ømall Frigat, that came
<pb facs="tcp:160222:3"/>
from the Rear-Admirall, who had been in fight th day before with five of the Queen of <hi>Swethlands</hi> ≈øhips, and eleven ≈øaile of Marchants ≈øhips, which they conveyed, being all laden with falt from <hi>Tubey</hi> in <hi>Portingale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rea≈øon of the fight was, the Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øh ≈øhips Wore flags, <hi>viz.</hi> Admirall, Vice-Admiral, and Rear-Admiral, which they refu≈øed to take in, or to low their top-≈øales (although commanded by cap. <hi>Owen,</hi> capt. of the Parliaments Reare-Admirall ≈øo to do.) Whereupon the ≈øaid capt. <hi>Owen</hi> gave them a broad ≈øide, in≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that divers ≈øhot pa≈øt betweene them, and great execution done upon the Switzers, ≈øcouring their upper decks with ≈ømall ≈øhot ≈øeverall times, captain <hi>Owen</hi> lo≈øt not above 8. men, be≈øides ≈øome few wounded, the fight continued ≈øixe hours, til night began to aproach, where the Swedi≈øh Fleet tooke their opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and got away. But ≈øo ≈øoon as Vice-admirall <hi>Batteu</hi> heard of it, he ≈øet ≈øaile with the St, <hi>Andrew, Garland, Convertine,</hi> and <hi>Mary-Ro≈øe,</hi> and ≈øtood over for the
<pb facs="tcp:160222:3"/>
Coa≈øt of <hi>France</hi> in the night; and in the morning about 8. of the clock, being the 3. of <hi>May,</hi> near <hi>Bulloign,</hi> he came up with the Admiral of the Swedes ≈øhip, who≈øe names was <hi>Martin Ty≈øin,</hi> the ≈øhip was called the <hi>Leopard,</hi> and had 32 Guns; the Vice-Admirall <hi>Daniell John≈øon,</hi> a lu≈øty ≈øtout ≈øhip, called the <hi>Angel Raphael,</hi> and had 24 Guns; the Rear-admirall the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptune, Moris Cook</hi> Captain, with 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The Captaines of all the≈øe ≈øheps, hee commanded aboard, and asked them, what they had done with his Rear-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral; they at fir≈øt denyed rhat they ≈øaw him, but he pre≈ø≈øing it ≈øo hard upon them at length confe≈ø≈øed, that they had beene in fight with him, and that the rea≈øon was, becau≈øe they would not take in their flags, being ≈øo commanded by their Queen, and had in≈øtructions to thar pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, which he cau≈øed them to ≈øend for, and took Copies of them, which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be true, in a high manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:160222:4"/>And they further told our Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Vice-admiral <hi>Batten,</hi> that they would rather dye in honour, then to go home and be hanged, for di≈øobeying their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øions; a brave re≈øolution, &amp; <hi>I</hi> could wi≈øh it were imprinted in the hearts of all our commanders: they further told him, that if their flaggs were then abroad, they would dy before they made one ≈øhot at him, though he ≈øhot never ≈øo many at them, yet would not take them in, and indeed were very re≈øpective to him. But they did much blame the Rear Admirall, for that all the ≈øhot he made was at their Vice-admirall, and Rear-admirall, &amp; not at their Admiral, whom he ought fir≈øt to have commanded; the others being ≈øubordinate to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; &amp; although he was 4. or 5. hours by the Admirals ≈øide, never ≈øhot Gun at him, but ≈øent his Boat 3 times aboard. Our Vice-admiral demanded of them, where the Rear-admirall left them, they told him off <hi>Beachy,</hi> which to him did ≈øeeme ≈øtrange, that he ≈øhould beginne a quarrell, and not follow them, till hee came

neer where the Vice-admirall was, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ≈øent a Frigot to him, to give him intelligence, &amp; might undoubtedly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his reliefe.</p>
            <p>All <hi>Munday</hi> was ≈øpent in taking of Examinations, and Copies of Commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions; the Swedi≈øh Commanders being detained aboard by our Vice-admirall as pri≈øoners, but u≈øed with great civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
            <p>At length a Gouncell of Warre was called by our Commander in chief with his Captaines, the re≈øult whereof was, that the Swedes Vice-admirall, who had beene the man which was mo≈øt active, was with his ≈øhip to be carryed into the <hi>Downes,</hi> till the plea≈øure of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament be further known, which was done acrordingly, and the next day we arrived in the <hi>Downes,</hi> being the 4. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant; the re≈øt of the Swedes in regard of theit ≈øhortne≈ø≈øe of Victuall, and having charge of the Convoy, were left to their own di≈øpo≈øe, and this was performed without ≈øhooting ≈øo much as a Musket; but truly, if the Queene of <hi>Swethland</hi>
